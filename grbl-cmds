* XYZmask is a value setting for the X Y and Z axes. Change if an axis is moving in the wrong direction. Value will be 0-7. ** Reporting units are independent of the units set in the Gcode!

Grbl Supported GCodes
Code	Description
F

Set Feed rate in Units/min (See G20/G21).

G0

A Rapid positioning move at the Rapid Feed Rate. In Laser mode Laser will be turned off.

G1

A Cutting move in a straight line. At the Current F rate.

G2

Cut a Clockwise arc.

G3

Cut an Anti-Clockwise arc.

G4

Pause command execution for the time in Pnnn. P specifies the time in seconds. Other systems use milliseconds as the pause time, if used unchanged this can result in VERY long pauses.

G10L2

Sets the offset for a saved origin using absolute machine coordinates.

G10L20

As G10 L2 but the XYZ parameters are offsets from the current position.

G17

Draw Arcs in the XY plane, default.

G18

Draw Arcs in the ZX plane.

G19

Draw Arcs in the YZ plane.

G20

All distances and positions are in Inches

G21

All distances and positions are in mm

G28

Go to safe position. NOTE: If you have not run a homing cycle and have set the safe position this is very ‘unsafe’ to use.

G28.1

Set Safe position using absolute machine coordinates.

G30

Go to the saved G30 position.

G30.1

Set Predefined position using absolute machine coordinates, a rapid G0 move to that position will be performed before the coordinates are saved.

G38.2

Probe towards the stock, error on a failure.

G38.3

As G38.2, no error on failure

G38.4

As G38.2 but move away, stop on a loss of contact.

G38.5

As G38.4, no error on failure.

G40

Cutter Compensation off. Grbl does not support cutter compensation.

G43.1

Dynamic Tool length offset, offsets Z end of tool position for subsequent moves.

G49

Cancel Tool length Offset.

G53

Use machine coordinates in this command.

G54

Activate the relevant saved origin.

G55-59

As G54, activates a different saved position

G61

Exact Path mode. Grbl does not support any other modes.

G80

Canned Cycle Cancel. Grbl does not support any of the canned cycle modes which this cancels so it does nothing.

G90

All distances and positions are Absolute values from the current origin.

G91

All distances and positions are Relative values from the current position.

G91.1

Sets Arc incremental position mode

G92

Sets the current coordinate point, used to set an origin point of zero, commonly known as the home position.

G92.1

Reset any G92 offsets in effect to zero and zero any saved values

G93

Inverse time motion mode.

G94

Units/min mode at the current F rate.

M0

Pause.

M1

As M0 but only pauses if an optional stop switch is on.

M2

Program End, turn off spindle/laser and stops the machine.

M3

Start spindle clockwise. In Laser mode sets Constant power.

M4

As M3, In Laser Mode sets Dynamic power.

M5

Stop the Spindle

M8

Coolant on as a flood. (Same as M7)

M9

Coolant off.

M30

Same as M2.

S

Set Spindle speed in RPM or Laser Power.

NOTE: Codes can contain leading zeros, G0 and G00 are the same. There are loads more GCodes, these are the ones Grbl supports. A lot of commands are Modal meaning they are remembered and applied to subsequent commands. For example, G0 X1 followed by Z5 remembers the G0 Mode and applies it to the Z5. S is modal, remembered from the last command. Two commands in the same modal group cannot be on the same line.

Grbl Gcode Parameters
Letter	Description
X Y Z

Distances or positions on the X Y Z axes.

I J K

Distances or positions for G2 and G3 Arcs. Correspond to the Z Y X axis respectively. These are always incremental coordinates regardless of G90/G91

L

Loop Cycle Count, supported but not used.

N

Line Number, supported but not used.

R

Arc radius for G2 and G3.

P

Multi-purpose parameter depends on command it is used in.

T

Tool selection, not used.

NOTE: All parameters must be followed by a number.

Grbl States
State	Description
Alarm

Homing enabled but homing cycle not run or error has been detected such as limit switch activated. Home or unlock to resume.

Idle

Waiting for any command.

Jog

Performing jog motion, no new commands until complete, except Jog commands.

Homing

Performing a homing cycle, won’t accept new commands until complete.

Check

Check mode is enabled; all commands accepted but will only be parsed, not executed.

Cycle

Running GCode commands, all commands accepted, will go to Idle when commands are complete.

Hold

Pause is in operation, resume to continue.

Safety Door

The safety door switch has been activated, similar to a Hold but will resume on closing the door. You probably don’t have a safety door on your machine!

Sleep

Sleep command has been received and executed, sometimes used at the end of a job. Reset or power cycle to continue.
