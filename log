instructions:

- make thing in inkscape
- in inkscape before you do anything, setup the document properties:
-- us letter, landscape
-- display unit: mm

- for fonts, use 'Extensions -> Text -> Hersey Text' to get something that is a single path

- you might need to do a Path -> Object To Path to convert everything to a path
- to export,  use extension: Extensions > gcodetools > path to gcode


- range (in mm)
-- x: 0-299
-- y: 0-250

commands:
-- cmd `m3 s90` lower pen
-- cmd `m5` raise pen

- manually moved the head all the way to the left and fully extended
- issued the command `g92 x0 y0` to set this as 0,0 origin
- `g1 x10 y50 f2000`

got hello world working. just use plain inkscape with default extension Extensions > gcodetools > path to gcode


- G00 Z5 == raise head
- G01 Z-0.125000 F100.0(Penetrate)

- s/G00 Z5.000000/M5 S90/g
- s/G01 Z-0.125000 F100.0/M3 s90/g
- s/F400.000000/F2000/g
- s/G00/G01/g

made fixup.sh to apply the above changes

Having issues with the pen touching the paper. Need to figure out if the issue is that we aren't level

- it seems like i mounted the pen upside down:
-- cmd `m3 s90` should raise the pen
-- cmd `m5` should lower the pen
--- m5 is making a noise
- nah, its fine


- manually moved the head all the way to the left and fully extended
- issued the command `g92 x0 y0` to set this as 0,0 origin
- `g1 x10 y50 f2000`
- range
-- x: 0-299
-- y: 0-250
